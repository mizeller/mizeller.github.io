Hello! My name is Michel, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer from Zurich, Switzerland. I studied Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://ethz.ch/" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a>.

By pure chance - or rather luck - I stumbled upon the captivating field of Computer Vision & am particularly interested in 3D computer vision and human-centric AI.

Beyond work I read voraciously, build plenty of side projects and try to live a full life away from all things digital.

<!-- Here's what I'm doing [now](/now/). -->
